# Vector2D
There is little example of showing how vector (in 2d) works.
In `vec2d.js` you can see vector realization and in `game.js` you can view how it is used to move circle to mouse.

To open example, download files and open `index.html` in your browser, move mouse over selected square and see "magic"

# Installing Vector2D
